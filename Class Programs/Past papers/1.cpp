/*Question:
A well-known Pakistani car dealership is developing an automated inventory management system to keep track of the cars available for sale.

You need to design a C++ class named Car that meets the following requirements:

1. Data Members
A data member to store the Car ID, which should be set at creation and must never change.
A string data member to store the model name.
A double data member to store the price of the car in Rs.
A pointer (char*) for dynamically storing the manufacturerâ€™s name.
A counter that keeps track of the total number of cars in the inventory.
2. Member Functions
Constructor:
Accepts car details as parameters and initializes all data members.
Copy Constructor:
Implements a copy mechanism to create a new Car object as a copy of an existing one.
Ensures that the manufacturer details are copied separately, so that changes to one object do not affect another.
3. Additional Functionalities
Accessor Functions:
Functions to retrieve the Car ID, Model Name, Price, and Manufacturer Details.
These functions should not modify any data members.
Inventory Count Function:
A function to return the total number of cars in inventory.
4. Main Function Requirements
Create an array of 2 Car objects with different car models available in Pakistan (e.g., Suzuki Alto, Honda City).
Display the total number of cars in inventory.
Prompt the user to enter a Car ID and search for the car in inventory.
If a car with the given ID exists, display its Model Name, Price, and Manufacturer.
If no car is found, display "Car not found."
Demonstrate the copy constructor by creating a copy of one of the cars and displaying its details.*/
